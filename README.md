# ü•ù FunFun - Exploring the monads in a functional world

From the learnings acquired from [Professor Frisby](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript), and Dr. Boolean's book: [Mostly Adequate](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide), I crafted this playground for monadic data types in Javascript. 

By far not production ready, just to have Fun~~Fun~~.
